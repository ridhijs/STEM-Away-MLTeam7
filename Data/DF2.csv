Both are customized with name and age. Most of them come back smelling like laundry detergent. There are options in the cancel return list for “Personal hygiene products cannot be returned” “Jewelry cannot be returned” etc so they should add an option that says “Handmade and custom products cannot be returned”. I just cancelled 2 returns for the first time and I am very nervous. I rarely ever get returns on Etsy but Amazon is another story. One of my items was listed for return as “Delivered too late” and it was actually delivered 2 days early! The second was “too small” but yet they didn’t post the return for 2 weeks after it was delivered. I know you shouldn’t assume but I’m going to guess that they held on to it for the party, then returned it. It’s so frustrating. Each shirt takes me time to make, not to mention the cost of supplies, electricity for me to run my equipment and I’m just trying to pay my bills over here.

So, if you’re selling it with personalization it will be a different item. You wouldn’t be able to reuse the same UPC for yours. There’s two ways to do it. You can register a brand, which I think now takes a trademark, and then you can sell under your own name with your own sku number (no UPC). Or, you can apply for Amazon Handmade, and sell it there, which does not require a brand registry or trademark. If you go that route, take them with all seriousness when they ask for pictures and details of the process and what you do to make the item. I sell an item that a Handmade seller makes and they declined me, because it was “handmade enough”. They even declined my appeal, when I included links to the other person’s items. You can only apply for Amazon Handmade every six months, so you could be out of business before you start for Christmas this year, if they decline you. Just a word of caution. I use Amazon Custom with my items (I do have a brand registry & trademark), but I don’t think either are required for Amazon Custom. So, you could try applying for that (I think you have to apply, I can’t remember), but you could try that route, and then see if maybe it’ll let you re-use the same sku. I don’t think the odds are good for you on that, but it’s certainly worth a try. The only other thing that you could maybe do, but I don’t know if there would be any repercussions from it, is buy your own UPC code, and “re-UPC” the items."

"" Each custom item must be listed with its own ASIN and only one active or inactive offer. This is to ensure that only one Seller is able to sell a custom feature on that specific product. This creates the best experience for your Buyers and instills trust in you as their Seller. While you may be the only Seller on the detail page, other Sellers might have this ASIN inactive in their inventory. We are unable to remove another Seller from a Custom Listing. I apologize for any inconvenience this might cause. To enable customization, you must delete and relist your items using a different unique product identifier (UPC, ASIN, EAN, etc.) than when you listed these items. This is the only way to ensure that you are the only one selling the item and enable you to customize your listings. You have two options if you do not have a unique product identifier that differs from what we have on the marketplace. The first option is to apply for a GTIN Exemption. Exemptions allow you to list your items without a unique product identifier. To learn more, see How to list products that do not have a GTIN (UPC, EAN, JAN, or ISBN): https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200426310?referral=A2IPAY1UX836X3_A1Z1FT0J89OTMM&referral=AS5E7XP0039ZB_A1Z1FT0J89OTMM 3 The second option is to purchase your own UPCs from a reputable distributor. Amazon cannot provide you with any suggestions for a distributor choice. Int he other hand, in case you want to apply for handmade, take into consideration: -All products available in your Handmade at Amazon store must be made entirely by hand, hand-altered, or hand assembled (not from a kit). -Products must be handmade by you (the artisan) ( not other artisan), or by one of your employees (if your company has 20 or fewer employees), -Mass-produced products or products handmade by a different artisan are not eligible to sell in Handmade. -UPCs are not required."

I completely understand the necessity of changing these settings as most of the times the “problem” can be fixed with just an email.

This is due to your return setting selection ""I want Amazon to automatically authorize and provide a prepaid shipping label for return requests that meet Amazon policy "". In order for the system not to auto-authorize a return, I would recommend selecting the one that says “when eligible” (2nd option). Keep in mind that these settings will affect regular orders and custom orders if the second option is not selected.

For further information about the Amazon return policy, see: https://amzn.to/2mGOPS5 6 (2) “I want Amazon to automatically authorize all return requests and provide a prepaid shipping label when eligible” indicates that all return requests will be automatically accepted and a prepaid return label issued. Only products (like handmade and custom) that are considered ineligible will be automatically authorized and no prepaid return label issued.

The customization information you referenced is good but the area we have trouble with is that the buyer cannot see the customization information with the order confirmation sent by Amazon. This has led to a few return requests when they mistakenly thought the product might be different from what they wanted.

Amazon Custom has a lot of viable options to create the type of listing you envision. There are a few different ways you can use Amazon Custom for your custom-sized tablecloths. You can use Product Configuration (List of Options), Text Customization, or a combination of the two. For Product Configuration, the Buyer would select from a list of options you provide on this listing. For Text Customization, Buyers would fill out text boxes for the Customization configuration Here is a useful Help Page on Product Configuration: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/202124210 12 Here is a useful Help Page on Text customization: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/202124230 3 You can always reach out to the Amazon Custom Team and we will happy to discuss setting up Customization for your items in further detail.

You can either participate in negotiation or keep firm. If your price is firm, it is a binary decision for the customer - buy or do not buy. If you decide to negotiate, you don’t have to accept their offer. You can counter with something that works for you. Your goal is to maximize your profit and one of the ways is with volume. Many sites offer free shipping with a minimum total purchase. You could set up a promotion to do just that. For example, if the customer buys $100 worth of product, they can have free shipping. You might even discount based on the quantity of units bought. OR both. You do not need to meet anyone’s pricing expectations.

That is not happening on this new feed (new product/template). Instead it goes to ‘see all buying options’. This is one of those Amazon things that may never be figured out. I’ve been in contact with the custom team…they know this is an issue. My question to them is who am I winning the buy box from if my product is custom and I’m the only one who has it?

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/api-developers-automated-system-for-amazon-custom/147103,"I just got my Amazon custom all automated by hiring an excellent programmer. Our current set up is We use Shipworks software to ship and print an extra packing list from Shipworks which doubles as work order/inventory control record Our Shipworks is on a Windows Machine We download all orders to Shipworks from all marketplaces Then through our custom control panel on the same machine we connect to Amazon MWS The programmer developed php script that connects to Amazon MWS and downloads the custom details for each Amazon order that contains the custom info. ( Our Windows Machine ( Shipworks Server ) now has php and MySQL installed so it can run this script ) Then the script connects to ShipWorks MSSQL database and inserts the custom info there Then we print our packing slips as usual via Shipworks and they contain Amazon Custom info along with all other Amazon order details. It was not cheap but it was in hundreds, not thousands costwise.

Next time post on the Selling on Amazon forum if you are a seller. If you are in the US and ordered off of Amazon.com then you are correct; an out of US seller must pay the customs fees. If you are in the US and ordering on a US site like Amazon.com you have every reason to expect any duties to already be paid by the out of US vendor. Contact Mystic and ask them for a refund for the fees. If they won’t do it, then you sould open an AZ claim for the amount of the duties."

As Style said, after at least 45 days, Amazon will automatically send you a reimbursement for the refund amount. Amazon gets the money from their shipping insurance and they send it over to you. I would also recommend looking through reports after 45 days especially if you have a large volume of orders and/or returns to see if Amazon reimbursed you for all the orders. I’ve noticed almost 50% of the time, the system does not automatically do so. If so, you can just file a case with a list of order #'s and Amazon usually takes care of it within a few hours."

Before you answer keep in mind nothing I am selling would be considered collectible by anyone. For example I have approx 50 - 75 wifi cards that came out of laptops I have worked on over the past couple month, (this also goes for the keyboards, ram,… well everything… about 1 out of 10 things are not marked as collectible and therefore lets me post. Even more perplexing is that there is no rhyme or reason to the grouping, the keyboard of one computer might be collectible but the HDD and ram covers are not collectible, or the Bluetooth and screen of one is restricted but ram and screen cover isnt. But I can sell the whole computer put together because thats not restricted. If all the parts and pieces are collectible wouldnt the computer as a whole also be considered collectible? > I don’t post electronics, but I would think components like wifi cards would need to be new. Amazon probably isn’t the best place to sell those things. > On that same note how / why is it possible for SOOOO many sellers to slap a sticker with there company name and call a product their own then threaten to sue me for posting in their personal space… There are not 50 people making 2gb DDR2 ram (well maybe there are 50 but they are not the ones listed here which include Computer memory solutions or Offtek Memory or A-Tech Components or one of my favorites: parts-quick.) > If it is a BRANDED product, like they are calling Apple by their own brand, it is a huge violation, If you have that item, you open a case with Seller Support, prove from the product’s webpage that the brand is wrong, and get it changed. Then you can post. On the other hand, with generic items, if it’s private labeled, even if yours looks the same, you cannot lit it there because the brand doesn’t match. At some point Amazon will stop the abuse by not allowing private labeling for anything but brand registered products, but for now make your own listing. Call it “generic,” which is really the way you are supposed to do it. > No offense to any of the above mentioned sellers if you stumble upon this thread. > I don’t do custom either; just happened to run across your post. > So if I pull some ddr2 ram out of a tough book (or any other part) I am restricted from selling it by its real name because for some reason 2 year old ram has become a collectors item, then I get lawsuit threats from every storefront who has a label maker. > Again, if you CAN list it, then get the brand fixed first and keep an eye on things to make sure the idiots don’t change it back. > Can I slap a label on a new Apple mac book laptop and sell it as a “Maxbook”?

We sell leather wallets on Amazon and are considering offering free personalization. I am concerned that Amazon might require us to accept returns even when nothing is wrong with the product - the customer just changes their mind or doesn’t like as in your case. Once the wallet is personalized, taking it back and refunding would be a financial hit. What did you decide to do? Also, can you explain Amazon Custom? Is that something we have to apply for?

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/amazon-custom-refunds-to-do-or-not-to-do/100693,"In reality the return policy for handmade isn’t much different from the rest of Amazon. If the buyer doesn’t feel your return policy is fair, or they just don’t like it, they are welcome to file a claim and have Amazon look at it. They are also welcome to leave negative feedback. Either of these steps will hurt your metrics and possible be enough to get you suspended. Yes, you can do everything by the book and still be suspended. I get products back where the buyer claimed they arrived damaged, but when they are returned, they are new, unopened and in perfect condition. The buyer makes this claim so that I’m expected to pay return shipping. I could fight it but that would just force the buyer to insure the item was indeed returned damaged and I would rather have the item back in resellable condition. Buyers of handmade will learn the same trick and will start gaming the system."

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/amazon-custom-refunds-to-do-or-not-to-do/100693,"The Amazon Custom team told us that we do NOT have to accept returns on customized items (unless it was our mistake or a broken item), but they also said that it would be a good idea to accept returns since it makes the buyer happy and it’s a must for (almost) every other category on Amazon. I guess this answer doesn’t help much and this is one of the reasons why we haven’t progressed in selling customized items, even we have been approved since day one. In my personal opinion, you might get away with not accepting the return (since you technically don’t have too) but we all know what happens when the buyer is complaining or opening an A-Z claim."
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/amazon-custom-refunds-to-do-or-not-to-do/100693,We currently sell on Handmade but heard about Amazon Custom on another forum. It was mentioned that the Custom option allows for a preview of personalization to the customer. Is this true? Thinking some of our products we don’t currently have listed in handmade would be a great fit for the Custom program due to personalization and the need for a “proof”. Anyone currently selling on custom that would be willing to share the ASIN to one of their Custom products so we can see what that looks like?

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/amazon-custom-refunds-to-do-or-not-to-do/100693,Thanks for the input. From what I have experienced so far is most of the general buyers on Amazon shop here because of amazons solid return policy. I think this policy should be different for custom sellers. Although I denied 2 claims because it was an his/hers product and the reason was just didn’t want it etc. I felt like this was some young buck that had broken up with her other half 5 WEEKS LATER! I have not experienced any AZ issues but my metrics were torn apart for customer satisfaction. I really hope the Amazon Custom Team resolves this issues. I have suggested that on custom items a seller return policy is shown before checkout.This would fix many many customers! I am not too interested in offering returns on personalized items that cant be re-personalized. I don’t know how the rest of the “custom” sellers feel but not I said the hen…

I sell many things that I cannot take back like candy or face cream. but, is it worth a metrics hit? is it worth fighting an a to z case? since they do not count denied a to z cases any more… they may still count good will or amazxon funded ones. we do not know at this point. so…only you know what is worth fighting for due to the price of the item.for anything under 40 bucks or so… I would not even consider fighting it an option. I most likely would not fight unless it was over a 100…but we all have our own ways of doing things./"
