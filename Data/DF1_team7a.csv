Testing requirements in toys and games category,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"My product is domino sets for adults. I am the exclusive branded seller of these. I have had several ASINs “yanked” and this is because since the products are in the toys and games category, Amazon wants certain test reports which are applicable to toys. However, my products are not toys and so not subject to testing. Amazon’s website says testing is required for toys intended for children 12 and under. Mine are not.

A-z claim says “different from what I ordered”, however, it is exactly the same as buyer ordered, it’s just that buyer entered in the wrong date. Another problem is “voice of the customer” metric. It shows some popular custom products in “very poor” category for things like “defective item” and “wrong item was sent” but this metric is wholly inaccurate because buyers enter in information they did not intend to. Lastly, recently received 2 “used sold as new” complaints from buyers opening return requests stating the product is defective because there is no option for “I entered in incorrect personalization information”.

Fake chinese sellers in custom,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom,"I just found a whole new batch of sellers selling the exact same thing in custom listed under different store names. Each and everyone of these sellers are selling the exact same thing, the exact same images, the exact same copy and the items in Custom are all setup exactly the same. This is not done by chance. This is not done by coincidence. This is done exactly the same. By the exact same person. The only difference is they have changed the name of the brand and changed the name of the store. And they aren’t very sophisticated or creative - check out these sellers all selling supposedly unique custom products. store: Billie Simon brand: Billieise store: Jennifer Watsonr. brand: Jeneifers store: Konggang business. brand: Tdyalm store: Yugang business store. Brand: Carpets I found 18 identical listings. They are going to keep doing this until it destroys the integrity of Amazon custom. I’ve seen this in November of 2016. Check your history. I was there in the fall of 2016 when I had fake sellers selling my own brand of custom t-shirts. Shirts that I created out of my own head and had copyrighted under my business. And it shut down that business that I had spent 10 years building - overnight. These sellers were selling my t-shirt designs for less, pushed their target shipping dates outside of their disbursement. They would generate a fake tracking number, tell the customer the order has been shipped, get a few fake reviews, then get their disbursement and ride that as long as they could. And when I contacted Amazon they told me to go through a long involved process to report copyright infringement that required me to actually buy one of these items, have it shipped to me, then send pictures of their product next to our product. Amazon was only helping them buy encouraging their sellers to purchase from them. They also said that we should contact the infringing seller to report them and give a cease and desist. I did that but due to Amazon’s policy of limiting contact between sellers, those messages were throttled to about 10 a day. I was getting about 30-40 stores a day listing my designs. I gave up after documenting over 300 violators selling my own designs. And they weren’t even getting creative. They had stores that were just peoples names or just random characters they hit on a keyboard. This looks all too familiar Amazon finally caught on about a month later but by then, the damage was done. My t-shirt business and many others went down. I now only sell maybe 1 of my custom t-shirt designs in a month. I managed to rebuild my business through Amazon custom because having the feed to upload the custom details created a 2nd level of sophistication that these scammers weren’t able to pull off. Now they’ve found another loophole. And it all looks exactly like 2016. This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve been here. If this is happening to you in Amazon Custom - report it. Shout from the rooftops. Email seller-performance@amazon.com. If your sales are down check into this. It could be that someone is flooding your category with fake stores, maybe even selling your own brands. If anybody has had any luck curtailing this please share. I’ve received little help from Amazon Seller Support.",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/fake-chinese-sellers-in-custom/478152
Any Way to Escalate A to Z Claim Before Being Forced to Authorzize Return?,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"We sold a buyer a diamond engagement ring in the Handmade Section on Amazon. In addition to being handmade, it was custom-sized to the buyer’s ring size specification. Item was shipped to buyer and about 1 week after delivery, we get a Return Request put in through/via Amazon Customer Service (not from buyer initiated process) indicating that the ring was “too bulky”. In other words, buyer’s remorse (more likely, buyer’s girlfriend turned him down and now we’re supposed to eat a moderately expensive handmade ring). We respond indicating that since this was a custom-made-to-order item, it was non-returnable under Amazon’s Custom and Handmade policy. Buyer then opens an A to Z claim with the following rambling (non-sensical) input from Customer Service: Customer comments: The seller do not want to accept the return cause the costumer disputes that size its too big. The product description does not switch sizes and it does not show that its not a returnable item. We respond to A to Z citing the policy, linking the policy and indicating that just because the buyer no longer wants or likes the item, does not change Amazon policy. Returns for this item are at the seller’s discretion. A to Z Claims department says nope, sorry you can eat this $900+ ring. Provide the buyer with return info within 3 days. So, is there anyway to escalate this above the A to Z folks to get someone that will actually enforce (or has read and understood) Amazon’s published policy on Handmade goods BEFORE being forced to provide return info.

"Sold customized product, customer not happy with image size the way HE configured it!",Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"I sold two items to a customer that are customizable items, where the customer can upload an image and they can configure the size and placement on the surface of the item themselves prior to submitting the order. In my listing, I show a few different examples where the image may take up most of the surface of the item, and some examples where based on the dimensions of the image, it is placed in an area on the item that does not take up the full surface. My listing clearly states that the image will be placed on the full surface of the item “as image size permits”, but for smaller images it will be placed on the lower surface. Both images that the customer uploaded had dimensions that prevented the full surface from being taken up by the image. The reason is because if I ignored the way the customer configured it himself and made the image larger to fill the full surface area, the left and right sides would have been cropped out. Therefore, in order to maintain the proper proportions of the image, it was sized to include the full image, which did not take up the full surface. The customer even configured it this way before he submitted the order, so not sure how he thought I was supposed to work some kind of magic to make it fill the entire surface without cutting out a good portion from the left and right sides. He submits a return request “wrong item sent” (of course) because he wasn’t happy that the image didn’t take up the full surface, and I politely responded and explained everything that I basically said here. I then ended off by telling him that if he still wishes to return them, he will be responsible for the return shipping and subject to a 50% restocking fee, since the item cannot be resold. This is the first time I have had to deal with a customer wanting to return a customizable item. I was curious if the same return policy still applies, or if a seller is not obligated to accept the return because the item is basically useless to the seller, since it was customized by the customer with his personal images? Also in this case, the customer was aware of the sizing and placement of the image on the surface since he placed it that way himself, and I basically replicated exactly what he did. Therefore, the product was produced to the exact specs that the customer provided. Seems unfair that I should get stuck with this.

For more information, click here. All orders must be fulfilled by you. The program is not available for products that are fulfilled by Amazon. All Custom Products must be sold in New condition. Used listings are not permitted. For more information, see the Condition guidelines. Your listings must have compliant product images. For more information, see Product image requirements.

You are able to comply with our return policies. For details, review the Return Policy for customized products.” In seller central i am currently registered for FBA.

This week I received an email from Amazon which states: “We will deprecate the prior version of Amazon Brand Registry on May 31, 2018, which may lead to a decreased authority over product listings on Amazon with your brand name and the removal of your ability to list products on Amazon without GTINs, UPCs, or EANs. If you are a seller who enrolled a brand in Amazon Brand Registry prior to May 2017, you must re-enroll your brand in the new version of Amazon Brand Registry to avoid any disruption in service.” However, in order to enroll in the new brand registry, you have to have a registered trademark, which can take up to a year to obtain! I am not sure how this is going to affect my sales of my personalized products in Custom. Does it mean they aren’t going to show up as much, or that I won’t be able to list new items? Do I have to apply for a trademark and enroll in the brand registry in order to keep getting GTIN exemptions? I looked into buying UPCs, but I have a lot of items and the legitimate ones through GS-1 would cost thousands of dollars which is way beyond the means of my small business. So I guess my question is can I still get a GTIN exemption to sell in Custom if I have to wait a year to get a trademark so that I can enroll in the new brand registry?

Racially Hateful Amazon Custom Request - What Do I Do?,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"Has anyone received something like this? What did you do? We received an Amazon Custom order from a person requesting we engrave a knife with a name, two swastikas and some text that translates in English to “the white calling”. I contacted Amazon support and requested they cancel the order and block the buyer from leaving feedback. They told me they couldn’t do that, but I should contact the customer and request they cancel the order themselves. The customer did not respond by the end of the business day before the item was set to ship, so we were forced to cancel it to void late shipment. I messaged support again on the same case and the agent said that I should contact support again to have the feedback removed if the buyer left negative feedback. The buyer left negative feedback, saying “Why was my order canceled?” This was after we sent multiple messages to the customer addressing the situation, and also after the customer emailed us on 12/17. She sent us an email asking why her order was canceled, to which we responded with two separate emails letting her know why. I opened another case with support to have the feedback removed, and the request was denied. The agent assisting on the case sent me back the standard copy-and-paste email that all denied requests for feedback removal get. I appealed it and the agent from the leadership team did the same copy and paste response. IMO Amazon has brought us a customer that requested we create a weapon with racially hateful statements and symbols on it. We should certainly be able to decline such a request without fear of repercussion, and negative feedback is certain in situations like this - all sellers know this. I feel like if Amazon does not protect Custom sellers against racially hateful requests like this, then Amazon is almost requesting that we make these products with hateful symbols and text. We have had other requests like this on other marketplace sites and we handle them the same way. We cannot be expected to create products with swastikas on it under threat of negative feedback. That is just as good as Amazon telling us we must do it, because multiple instances of negative feedback means account suspension. Even if we comment on it, our average and search results are still negatively affected.

Amazon automatically generating return labels for Custom Products on SFP?,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"Hi. Is anyone selling custom products with Seller Fulfilled Prime? We just started doing this and we have hit a snag. Before SFP, if a customer wanted to return the item, we would usually issue a refund and just say “keep it”. Once we print it with a custom decoration, we can’t resell it of course. But with SFP, Amazon handles all these refund requests for us. They are issuing return labels and we have to pay the postage, even though we don’t want it back. Is it possible to change a setting somewhere in our account? Some kind of “never issue a return label” setting?

I need direct communication with the buyer if the image uploaded is not suitable. The buyer should have to check a box confirming that they will allow phone calls from the seller if it a custom items image does not comply with the guidelines. In every case where a non-solicitation option is turned on, or the buyer does not respond in time, and I need to talk to the customer it affects my performance. Here is how to fix it: In the customize now widow add a text box for a phone number and a confirmation checkbox to confirm that the customer allows commutation with the seller in case of image correction. The checkbox fixes privacy issues and by provide a number it provide security in that if the image is wrong the buyer will be contacted. My number one phone call ask “what will happen if the image is not right” adding a mandatory phone number fixes this. It also will reduce inaccurate reviews when needed commutation was not provided due to flaws in the system. This will help improve amazons system as a whole.

Amazon Frustration?,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"Does anyone find them selves irritated when reading the Amazon forums? I do, and it’s because 80% of the issues originate from a lack of “Amazon Seller Protection”, “Seller Support”, “Performance Metrics” and the “Amazon Escalation Team”…80% my friends! Has anyone considered the fact that Amazon doesn’t care about any one seller in particular and keeps capitalizing and manipulating the power of the position that they’ve acquired in this marketplace! Furthermore, does anyone think that Amazon DOESN’T have accounts set up to respond to our posts in these forums? Of course they do, wouldn’t you if you we’re them (if you had no integrity, morals or ethics)? This is why they do nothing after you’ve proven your innocence and or explained properly why something has negatively affected your metrics and you would like it to be corrected As like the rest of the world, if your not a 1 percenter, YOUR NO ONE to Amazon. You will get moderate help but at the end of it all, you will be ignored. At that point, “Bots” take over and your account and account metrics as well as the majority of your correspondences will be dealt with by the “Bots”. We’re just get left dangling in the wind receiving an I’m sorry, but that’s all I can do or maybe repetitive emails saying they’re still working on your issue. It’s even funnier when you keep getting those “Bot” emails for 2 or even 3 weeks and the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, Amazon has a huge chunk of the market and even though we’re treated terribly, we still stay. Eventually their open/free marketplace will not be available to the common person as Amazon will have ran us down to a point where we MUST move on, giving them the entire table like they want. Granted that’s a long time away but mark my words, it will happen. I do understand that Amazon is a business and is expected to operate as such (making money) but with that being said, They’re supposed to be “IN BUSINESS WITH US” and that’s definitely not what their actions say to me. On the contrary, I feel as if they do the bare minimum to keep Sellers thinking that Amazon is your partner in this marketplace when truly, they are not. I realize I have some questions in this statement but after reading what I’ve wrote, it feels more like a sad story. Please feel free give me your opinion on anything I’ve mentioned or anything else for that matter. Also, if you don’t have anything useful or good to say, please don’t attack me or anyone else in this post. Yes, Please have an opinion but there’s no need to be rude. Anyways, good luck to all Amazon Sellers with a prosperous 2017 and have a blessed evening!

Confirmed delivered denied in A-Z claim!,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"No I don’t know about any of you other sellers out there right now but I’m tired of the A-Z claims where the buyer claims he or she never received the item when it’s been clearly marked delivered by the carrier. Here are Amazon’s “rules or guidelines” they go by when there’s an “Items Not Received” A-Z Claim Additional Information about A-to-z Guarantee Claims for Items Not Received Sellers are accountable for resolving A-to-z Guarantee claims for items Not Received and the claims will be processed according to the following policies: Products(s) Shipped without Tracking A seller will be liable for a not received claim if Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) has passed and the order was shipped without tracking information. This policy will apply to all orders, including those shipped by media mail. Product(s) Shipped with Tracking - In Transit If a product is not delivered by the end of the EDD range, and tracking information shows an expected delivery in the near future (and the product was shipped by the promised ship date of two business days from the order date) the claim will not be granted and the buyer will be asked to wait for the product. The seller will not be liable. However, if tracking information does not show expected delivery in a reasonable timeframe, the claim will be granted and the seller will be held liable. This will apply to packages lost in transit as well. Product(s) Shipped with Delivery Confirmation Tracking - Tracking Shows Delivery and Buyer Claims Item Not Received The A-to-z Guarantee team will investigate the dispute. Amazon may contact the buyer to confirm non-receipt. If no receipt is confirmed, the seller may still be held liable for lack of fulfillment - Amazon will not cover service errors, including loss, theft, or postal/shipping issues. Amazon will, however, continue to protect sellers from fraudulent buyers and A-to-z Guarantee abusers. Product(s) Shipped with Signature Confirmation Tracking - Tracking Shows Delivery and Buyer Claims Item Not Received If the name on the signature confirmation matches the buyer, the A-to-z Guarantee team will deny the claim. If signature confirmation does not match the buyer, the A-to-z Guarantee team will deny the claim and ask the buyer to follow-up with the individual that signed for the package. Guarantee claims for packages that are signed for by a freight forwarder or an agent of the buyer (e.g. receptionist, family member) will be denied. However, if an investigation determines that the customer did not receive the order due to a shipping error beyond his or her control, the seller may be held liable. We anticipate that this would be a very rare occurrence Now I don’t know about any of you other sellers but if Amazon won’t cover service errors, including loss, theft, or postal/shipping issues why should the seller if it’s been confirmed delivered by the carrier? I know that we hit every single one of these guidelines and requirements but we still have been getting charged for these types of A-Z Claims and it’s starting to cost us a lot more money and we’re going to have to start adding a percentage to every order it continues to get worse.",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/confirmed-delivered-denied-in-a-z-claim/243989

Case I define my casepacks for FBA shipments?,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"Hello, I have products prepacked from the factory in a musical run case. For example: a casepack contains 6 units in 4 sizes (4 skus): 1S, 2M, 2L, 1XL. Can I ship my cases this way to Amazon FBA? Or can I only ship casepacks that contain the same SKU (ie. case contains all size S)? When I try to create my shipping plan with the casepack option, it looks like Amazon defines a casepack as units with the same SKU. There’s no option for me to define my casepack to have 1 case = 1S, 2M, 2L, 1XL. And when I tried the individual option - Amazon doesn’t allow me to allocate my units to a defined case. Amazon does the unit allocation which can result in me having to break my original casepack and repack to ship to multiple DCs. For example: Amazon assigns 1S to ship to a DC, 1M and 1L to ship to another DC, 1M to ship to another DC, 1L and 1XL to another DC. Which means I would need to have my warehouse take 1 case and repack it into 4 new cases. Doing this would be too costly due to the pick and pack labor and the cost of the additional cartons needed to repack into. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of scenario? Or is the only solution to have the factory ship cases that contain only 1 SKU inside.

Not only is this the only forum I can post in its the only forum I can see the questions / answers on. The whole help section in my seller central all leads me to pages that say: Seller Forums Amazon Seller Forums Sorry, you do not have permission to view this content. and then when I start directly from the forums home page all it will let me access is the Amazon custom forums. My original question: Why is 99% of the items I am trying to list market as collectible and off limits for me to sell in? Before you answer keep in mind nothing I am selling would be considered collectible by anyone. For example I have approx 50 - 75 wifi cards that came out of laptops I have worked on over the past couple month, (this also goes for the keyboards, ram,… well everything… about 1 out of 10 things are not marked as collectible and therefore lets me post. Even more perplexing is that there is no rhyme or reason to the grouping, the keyboard of one computer might be collectible but the HDD and ram covers are not collectible, or the Bluetooth and screen of one is restricted but ram and screen cover isnt. But I can sell the whole computer put together because thats not restricted. If all the parts and pieces are collectible wouldnt the computer as a whole also be considered collectible? On that same note how / why is it possible for SOOOO many sellers to slap a sticker with there company name and call a product their own then threaten to sue me for posting in their personal space… There are not 50 people making 2gb DDR2 ram (well maybe there are 50 but they are not the ones listed here which include Computer memory solutions or Offtek Memory or A-Tech Components or one of my favorites: parts-quick.) No offense to any of the above mentioned sellers if you stumble upon this thread. So if I pull some ddr2 ram out of a tough book (or any other part) I am restricted from selling it by its real name because for some reason 2 year old ram has become a collectors item, then I get lawsuit threats from every storefront who has a label maker. Can I slap a label on a new Apple mac book laptop and sell it as a “Maxbook”? Isn’t that the same thing as peeling off the labels of Panasonic batteries or Kingston ram?

Do I need a BILL OF LADING for an Express Shipment, or is that only for SHIPMENTS? If I get one, how and when do I get the BOL, and from whom? YOU’RE WELCOME TO USE MY TEMPLATE, IT’S RATHER COOL!

"Amazon support = robot copy-paste responses, bad English, very slow",Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"Hello, is it just me or has Amazon support become extremely slow and bad quality? Prior to 2013-2014 whenever I opened a case it was resolved promptly and with little effort on our end. Now it can weeks (some simple cases take a month) for a case to be resolved. It seems to tie in approximately when Amazon decided to outsource their call centers to India in 2013-2014. Moreover, I find the Indian call centers frequently misunderstand the question or just copy and paste vague robot like responses.

Amazon Custom improvement comments,Amazon Custom,Amazon Custom Forum,"I was wondering if there was a particular e-mail address or place to provide suggestions / comments about Amazon Custom? We have a fairly large product set that would cater extremely well to the Custom program but currently there are some deal-breaking items that will prevent us from listing our products. Some are; Increase the limit of text print areas (currently 5). Due to the nature of our products and the way Amazon Custom handles font sizes, we need roughly 8 to 10 to work with the majority of our products. Allow for multiple photo uploads on a single surface. We offer photo collages which only work with this. Allow for font selection and font color PER text block. Our designs typically have multiple font styles within them and due to the background, the font color needs to change in areas to make sure the text is visible. Allow for both photo AND text blocks. Currently its photo OR text blocks. I’m aware the photo option allows for a single custom positionable text block. Upload fonts at a global level We are extremely anxious to get our products listed, I hope these items can be resolved as these all make Amazon Custom more seller friendly. Thanks!
